 TODO: Create the Birthday page for the Luma Fam website.

 Please put images in the assets folder for organization.

 The title is Next Birthday, and there should be an image and text below it.
 There is a circular image for the luma fam member in front of a star.

 There is a json file that has birthdays for each fam member. Find the
 next date and have it be displayed.

 If it is the current birthday, then be creative and add something unique for it.
