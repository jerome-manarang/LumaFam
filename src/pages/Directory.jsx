 TODO: Create the Directory page for the Luma Fam website.

 Please put images in the assets folder for organization.

 The title is Directory, and there should be an image and text below it.
 There is a circular image for each luma fam member in front of a star.
 I recommend using canva for the images.

 Two ways to do this:

 Make it like a carousel where the user can press an arrow and it reveals more
 stars/luma fam members

 OR

 Animated where the stars are all moving by themselves.
