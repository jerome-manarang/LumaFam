 TODO: Create an animated sticky header for the luma fam website

 Inspo: https://lahacks.com/home

 It will have the follow sections:

Hangouts
Fam Heads
FUSION at UCI
Directory

You can be creative as you want with this. It should have a star as the animation, and
it should move as you scroll down.

The headers should be clickable and bring you to the section.
